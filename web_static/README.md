# Project: 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

# __Background Context__
__Web static, what?__

Now that we have a command interpreter for managing the AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

- Create simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything

During this project, we learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages.

- HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write.
- CSS is the styling of your page, the design.

It is encouraged that you fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.
